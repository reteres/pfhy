功夫平静，你的红袖究竟摆脱了我陈旧的行装，你毕竟做了一场奢侈的梦，此后，在谁人与我针锋相对的寰球，你回身而过，此后迷途，但我，仍旧是首先的妙龄。
　　到站后，我们随便住进火车站附近一家宾馆，洗漱之后便找车去沙湖。驱车往西北56公里，就到了平罗县境内沙湖。据介绍，沙湖拥有1万亩水域、5000亩沙丘、2000亩芦苇、1000亩荷池。据说，沙湖盛产鱼、鸟。鱼在水底，我无法见到，这么大片的水域不会没有鱼吧？鸟呢，也许大多躲于芦苇里，也许迁徙到别的地方，不知此时是不是沙湖观鸟佳期，我没问，也没查资料。说有白鹤、黑鹤、天鹅等十几种鸟类，数万只在这里栖居，有时象移动的乌云在天空左右盘旋，遮天蔽日，它们的窝巢就筑在水边的苇杆间、芦丛底，每年春季各种颜色的鸟蛋散布其间，游客可在观鸟塔上遥看群鸟嬉戏。我可没看到这大自然的一大奇观，应当是我的遗憾。
	25、若有来生，后会无期。《后会无期》
I put it in his hand, carefully it is struggling, it's face told me, not because of fear, but just feel uncomfortable in my hands.
Its strength is too small, my finger slightly a crowded, will be the death of it.
However, it does not regard me as will bring its deadly enemy, its eyes tell me, it can withstand a lot of things.
Oh, this is what a kind of strength, able to make it not afraid of any danger?
A distant unknown river, is where it should go.
When I put it in the house on the edge of the river, thinking, it won't understand my behavior, in the rainy days that followed, it will travel, to look for it appointed thereunto, the unknown aureate fantasy land.

People have the heart of the poem, lives in the poem, and external integration of poetry.
Although poetry is doing, but was born.
The so-called do, however, is to be born out of the stuff to regulation.
